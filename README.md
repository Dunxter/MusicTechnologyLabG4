# ICCM: Instrument Classification in Carnatic Music
Instrument Classification in Carnatic Music (ICCM) is a project developed for the Music Technology Lab optative course, at Universitat Pompeu Fabra.

It aims to create a tool for musicologists, musicians and enthusiasts alike to identify and visualize the presence of the main instruments found in Carnatic music tradition (human voice, violin, tanbura and mridangam) in a piece of the userâ€™s choice. 

This will be achieved through the training of a ML predictive model that will be able to classify each instrument, ultimately creating a graphical representation of the in and outs of each instrument through the length of a performance.

In order to use this model you must follow the following steps:

  1) Download and execute the code Install_dataset to obtain the saraga1.5_carnatic dataset (16.2 GB) using the corresponding functions of the mir-data library. The download might take a long time depending on the connection.
  2) Download and execute step by step the code Dataset_Creation.ipynb to obtain a dataset of .wav chunks of carnatic music (If you already have a dataset in the corresponding format this step is not necessary).
  3) Download and execute step by step the code Feature_Extraction.ipynb to get the dataset features in .csv format (If you already have a file with the features of your dataset in the corresponding format this step is not       necessary).
  4) Download and run step by step the Modelling.ipynb code to create a ML model and see the results.
