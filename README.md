# ICCM: Instrument Classification in Carnatic Music
Instrument Classification in Carnatic Music (ICCM) is a project developed for the Music Technology Lab optative course, at Universitat Pompeu Fabra.

It aims to create a tool for musicologists, musicians and enthusiasts alike to identify and visualize the presence of the main instruments found in Carnatic music tradition (human voice, violin, tanbura and mridangam) in a piece of the userâ€™s choice. 

This will be achieved through the training of a ML predictive model that will be able to classify each instrument, ultimately creating a graphical representation of the in and outs of each instrument through the length of a performance.
